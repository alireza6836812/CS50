If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
their audio aura can be characterized by calculating the average
energy, valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs. The audio
aura can be determined by assigning a color to each of six mood descriptor
categories (including happy, calm, and hopeful) and matching them with tracks on Spotify.

However, this method of calculating the audio aura might not be very
representative of the listener because it only takes into account the top 100
songs of the listener from the past year.

A better way of calculating the audio aura would be to analyze the listener's entire
music history on Spotify, rather than just their top 100 songs from the past year.
This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the listener's music preferences and moods.
