Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
for a small number the output can be random,
for example a team like Brazil can have first time a chance of 60% and the next time 10%.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
Upon executing 10,000 simulations, the results became consistent,
indicating Belgium as the top contender, with Brazil trailing closely.
The outcomes tend to remain unchanged post 10,000 simulations, hence,
I deem this number to be satisfactory.
